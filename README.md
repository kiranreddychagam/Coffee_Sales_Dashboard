# Coffee_Sales_Dashboard
In this project, I created an interactive dashboard using coffee orders data, leveraging Excel functions like IF, XLOOKUP, and INDEXMATCH to clean and sort data. A Pivot Table was used for data analysis and visualization. I also designed custom templates for the Pivot Chart Timeline and Slicer, enhancing the dashboard's interactivity and usability.
